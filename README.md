# ghostfs
This repository allows deploying a GhostFS Server and Auth Server, and a GhostFS Auth Backend.

## Install
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the cloned folder.
2. Copy the template file:
   ```bash
   cp auth_backend/auth_backend.env.template auth_backend/auth_backend.env
   ```
   In the newly created file, update the domain name to where the GhostFS Auth Backend will run on.
3. To generate a self-signed SSL certificate and key for the GhostFS Server running on the same `domain_name` as above, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    ./gen_cert.sh <domain_name>
    ```
4. If needed, edit the `.env` to update the version of GhostFS Server and Auth Server.
5. To install a GhostFS server and a GhostFS Auth Backend running on PM2 with a Caddy reverse proxy, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    ./install_ghostfs.sh
    ```
    When requested, enter a username and password for the GhostFS Auth Backend `htpsswd`.
6. Verify that everything is running correctly using:
    ```bash
    sudo pm2 status
    ```
7. Verify that there are no errors in the logs of each process:
     ```bash
     sudo pm2 logs <id>
     ```
